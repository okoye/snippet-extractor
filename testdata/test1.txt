Little Star, Delfina, Golden Boy, Pizza Orgasmica...there are many pizza places in the city that word has it 'do not suck', because let's be honest, West Coast pizza sucks. That's right, I said it, and you should have known this already. Golden Boy is my favorite so far but after trying Little Star it's going to be my local favorite (the schlop on Lower Haight is only good for drunk eating).

Ambiance (4): Standard issue hipster-ish interior with low lights, mixture of wood and metal, and some art on the wall. Not complaining, it's good to go, just not what I expect of a pizza joint. 

Food (4): They are known for their deep dish but after going to Chicago a few times, I have sworn off deep dish pizza. It's just too much...too much! We had a thin crust with pancetta, goat cheese, chicken, and I don't remember what else (it had me at pancetta). It was pretty tasty and the crust was good and crisp. We ordered the smaller size since we were having wings too and it was just the right size. The chicken wings were not bad, but I haven't had a chicken wing that doesn't remind me of microwaveable buffalo wings since Sports Grill (new English rule: double negative bad, triple negative good). This might be related to the wings not being grilled, which is my preferred wing preparation method. In terms of drinks, I appreciate that they have tempranillo and malbec in stock in addition to the usual suspects, so if you like red wine, they are bound to have something that appeals to your tastes. Of course they have beer and white wine too. Also the 10 dollar corkage fee is appreciated.

Service (4): Great, friendly service. The timing of the dishes arriving was perfect and I don't know if it's coincidence or the server putting in the order in a certain way or us eating at just the right rate. Anyway, I felt welcomed and being taken care of without the incessant and forced niceties of some fancy restaurants (I am looking at you Gary Danko). There always seems to be a wait to get a table though, but what can you do when the place has good foodie cred?

Value (4): The prices of all menu items seemed just right. That includes the cost of drinks and I already mentioned the corkage fee.

Overall: I liked this place but did not love it like I do Golden Boy. The quality is good and the flavors were good but just not amazing. However, this the best option in my area, so next time take out will be the way to go to avoid the wait. Oh and if you have a deep dish craving, this is one of the few places in the city that I have spotted it so far.
