Little Star, Delfina, Golden Boy, Pizza Orgasmica...there are many pizza places in the city that word has it 'do not suck', because let's be honest, West Coast pizza sucks. That's right, I said it, and you should have known this already. Golden Boy is my favorite so far but after trying Little Star it's going to be my local favorite (the schlop on Lower Haight is only good for drunk eating).

Ambiance (4): Standard issue hipster-ish interior with low lights, mixture of wood and metal, and some art on the wall. Not complaining, it's good to go, just not what I expect of a pizza joint. 

Food (4): They are known for their deep dish but after going to Chicago a few times, I have sworn off deep dish pizza. It's just too much...too much! We had a thin crust with pancetta, goat cheese, chicken, and I don't remember what else (it had me at pancetta). It was pretty tasty and the crust was good and crisp. We ordered the smaller size since we were having wings too and it was just the right size. The chicken wings were not bad, but I haven't had a chicken wing that doesn't remind me of microwaveable buffalo wings since Sports Grill (new English rule: double negative bad, triple negative good). This might be related to the wings not being grilled, which is my preferred wing preparation method. In terms of drinks, I appreciate that they have tempranillo and malbec in stock in addition to the usual suspects, so if you like red wine, they are bound to have something that appeals to your tastes. Of course they have beer and white wine too. Also the 10 dollar corkage fee is appreciated.

Service (4): Great, friendly service. The timing of the dishes arriving was perfect and I don't know if it's coincidence or the server putting in the order in a certain way or us eating at just the right rate. Anyway, I felt welcomed and being taken care of without the incessant and forced niceties of some fancy restaurants (I am looking at you Gary Danko). There always seems to be a wait to get a table though, but what can you do when the place has good foodie cred?

Value (4): The prices of all menu items seemed just right. That includes the cost of drinks and I already mentioned the corkage fee.

Overall: I liked this place but did not love it like I do Golden Boy. The quality is good and the flavors were good but just not amazing. However, this the best option in my area, so next time take out will be the way to go to avoid the wait. Oh and if you have a deep dish craving, this is one of the few places in the city that I have spotted it so far.

 ate here years ago after reading an excellent review of it by Patricia
 Unterman, which I can't find any where, even on the Examiner's website.  It
 was probably lost in the course of the various regime changes at the paper.
 However, there are 2 more current reviews in the Chonicle, which reinforce my
 opinion of the place.

 It was difficult to find, but well worth the effort and part of the charm of
 the restaurant is it's exclusiveness -- a secret place that only you and a few
 other people know about.  It's also not cheap, but worth every penny. I had
 the omakase and can't remember specifically what I ate because it's been so
 long, except for a unique squid ink dish.  However, it was all excellently
 prepared, but the cuisine is not for someone looking for sushi or a sukiyaki
 combo plate.  All of the dishes are uniquely and authentically Japanese and,
 if you've never had a koryori-ya experience previously, it's probably unlike
 any Japanese food you've ever had before, including some very "acquired taste"
 type dishes that you may or may not enjoy.  Let's put it this way, if you
 don't like uni, you probably won't like some of the dishes presented to you at
 Kappa, but if you don't try them, it will be your loss.  

 Anyway, reading the critics' and Yelp reviews and reflecting on my prior
 experience there, reminds me that it's been too long since I've been to Kappa
 and that I need to go back there again soon!
